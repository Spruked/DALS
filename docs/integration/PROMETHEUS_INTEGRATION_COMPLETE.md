- Performance metrics logging
- Compatible with Prometheus Prime logging infrastructure

### 5. **Complete Deployment Stack**
- **Dockerfile** with multi-stage build for production
- **docker-compose.yml** with full stack (Redis, Consul, monitoring)
- **deployment script** (`deploy.sh`) for automated deployment
- **environment configuration** (`.env.example`)
- **comprehensive documentation** (`DEPLOYMENT.md`)

## ðŸ”Œ Integration Points

### API Gateway Integration
```python
# In your API Gateway main.py:
@app.post("/api/v1/reason", response_model=ReasoningResponse)
async def process_reasoning(request: ReasoningRequest):
    iss_service = await service_registry.get_service("iss-controller")
    async with http_client as client:
        response = await client.post(
            f"{iss_service.url}/api/v1/process",
            json=request.dict()
        )
        return response.json()
```

### Service Discovery
```yaml
# Automatic registration:
service:
  name: iss-controller
  url: http://iss-controller:8003
  health_check: /health
  capabilities: [reasoning_processing, vault_queries, time_anchoring]
```

### Vault Integration
```python
# Query ISS vault from other services:
vault_request = VaultQueryRequest(query={"category": "reasoning"})
response = await iss_client.post("/api/v1/vault/query", json=vault_request.dict())
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Deploy Immediately
```bash
# Make deployment script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Deploy full stack
./deploy.sh deploy

# Check status
./deploy.sh status
```

### 2. Verify Integration
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8003/health

# API documentation
open http://localhost:8003/docs

# Test reasoning endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/api/v1/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input_data": {"query": "test"}, "timeout_ms": 1000}'
```

### 3. Integration Test
```bash
# Run comprehensive integration tests
python test_integration.py
```

## ðŸ“‹ API Endpoints Ready for Your Gateway

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Called By |
|----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| `/health` | GET | Service health check | Load balancer, monitoring |
| `/api/v1/process` | POST | Main reasoning pipeline | API Gateway |
| `/api/v1/vault/query` | POST | Query vault entries | API Gateway, other services |
| `/api/v1/log` | POST | Add captain's log entry | Any service |
| `/api/v1/status` | GET | Detailed service status | Monitoring, debugging |

## ðŸ”§ Configuration for Your Environment

### Basic Integration (`.env`)
```bash
# Service Configuration
ISS_SERVICE_NAME=iss-controller
ENVIRONMENT=production
ISS_PORT=8003

# Your Prometheus Prime Integration
API_GATEWAY_URL=http://your-api-gateway:8000
SERVICE_REGISTRY_URL=http://your-consul:8500

# External Services (update with your URLs)
COCHLEAR_PROCESSOR_URL=http://cochlear-processor:8001
PHONATORY_OUTPUT_URL=http://phonatory-output:8002
VAULT_MANAGER_URL=http://vault-manager:8004
```

## ðŸ“Š Logging & Monitoring Ready

### Structured Logs (JSON Format)
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T22:15:30.123Z",
  "level": "info",
  "service": "iss-controller",
  "correlation_id": "abc-123-def",
  "message": "Reasoning request completed",
  "cycle_id": "iss_1696284930123",
  "processing_time_ms": 450.2
